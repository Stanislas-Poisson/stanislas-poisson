Feature: Exemple test
    In order to test Behat
    I used the application

    Scenario: I should go to the homepage and see some text
        Given I am on the homepage
        Then I should see "Laravel has wonderful, thorough documentation covering every aspect of the framework. Whether you are new to the framework or have previous experience with Laravel, we recommend reading all of the documentation from beginning to end."
