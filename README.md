# Stanislas Poisson

This repository is intended to manage my website and thus show my resume.

**About me**  
Looking for a developer?
It's a good thing! Passionate about the web world, I have acquired skills through my professional and self-taught experiences.
I like to discover, learn and experiment web development and web-design as I go along.

**My recipe ?**  
Take knowledge in the following areas:
Back-end 95%, Front-end 75%, Server 50%.
Sprinkle a good pinch of curiosity on the whole.
Mix it all in an unconventional mold and heat it on a creative fire and you get a Full-Stack developer.

**For info ;)**  
36 years old, and happy father of two children. Living in Tours, France I am mobile in and around the agglomeration via public transport.
